## How to Add GitHub Topics and Tags

GitHub Topics can be added through multiple methods. Below are detailed instructions for each approach:

---

### Method 1: GitHub Web Interface (Easiest)

This is the most straightforward method and doesn't require any command-line tools.

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to your repository: https://github.com/Baneeishaque/Python-TUI-Scripts
2. Click on the **⚙️ (gear icon)** next to "About" section on the right sidebar
3. In the "Topics" field, type each topic and press Enter or comma
4. Click "Save changes"

**Pros:**
- No technical knowledge required
- Visual interface
- Immediate preview of topics

**Cons:**
- Manual process
- Requires web browser access

---

### Method 2: GitHub CLI (gh)

GitHub CLI is the official command-line tool for GitHub operations.

#### Installation:

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install gh
```

**Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg | sudo dd of=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list > /dev/null
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gh
```

**Windows:**
```bash
winget install --id GitHub.cli
```

Or using Chocolatey:
```bash
choco install gh
```

#### Authentication:
```bash
gh auth login
```

Follow the prompts to authenticate with GitHub.

#### Adding Topics:

**Important Note:** As of the current version, `gh` CLI doesn't have a direct command to manage repository topics. However, you can use the GitHub API through `gh api`:

```bash
# Add topics using GitHub API
gh api --method PUT /repos/Baneeishaque/Python-TUI-Scripts/topics \
  -f names='["python","python-scripts","automation","cli-tools","utilities","pillow","google-keep","gkeepapi","google-oauth","homebrew","docker","vagrant","azure-pipelines","ci-cd","developer-tools","scripts","python3","image-processing","google-api","devops"]'
```

**View current topics:**
```bash
gh api /repos/Baneeishaque/Python-TUI-Scripts/topics
```

**Pros:**
- Fast and scriptable
- Can be automated
- Works from terminal

**Cons:**
- Requires installation and setup
- Requires API knowledge for topics

---

### Method 3: GitHub REST API with curl

You can use the GitHub REST API directly with curl or any HTTP client.

#### Prerequisites:
- GitHub Personal Access Token with `repo` scope
- curl or similar HTTP client

#### Create Personal Access Token:
1. Go to GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Select scopes: `repo` (full control of private repositories)
4. Generate and copy the token

#### API Command:

**Set environment variable with your token:**
```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_personal_access_token_here"
```

**Add topics:**
```bash
curl -X PUT \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "names": [
      "python",
      "python-scripts",
      "automation",
      "cli-tools",
      "utilities",
      "pillow",
      "google-keep",
      "gkeepapi",
      "google-oauth",
      "homebrew",
      "docker",
      "vagrant",
      "azure-pipelines",
      "ci-cd",
      "developer-tools",
      "scripts",
      "python3",
      "image-processing",
      "google-api",
      "devops"
    ]
  }' \
  https://api.github.com/repos/Baneeishaque/Python-TUI-Scripts/topics
```

**Get current topics:**
```bash
curl -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/Baneeishaque/Python-TUI-Scripts/topics
```

**Pros:**
- Direct API access
- Can be integrated into scripts
- Platform independent

**Cons:**
- Requires token management
- More complex syntax
- Security considerations for token storage

### Method 4: Python Script Using PyGithub

You can use the PyGithub library to manage topics programmatically.

#### Installation:
```bash
pip install PyGithub
```

#### Python Script:

```python
from github import Github

# Authentication
token = "your_personal_access_token_here"
g = Github(token)

# Get repository
repo = g.get_repo("Baneeishaque/Python-TUI-Scripts")

# Define topics
topics = [
    "python",
    "python-scripts",
    "automation",
    "cli-tools",
    "utilities",
    "pillow",
    "google-keep",
    "gkeepapi",
    "google-oauth",
    "homebrew",
    "docker",
    "vagrant",
    "azure-pipelines",
    "ci-cd",
    "developer-tools",
    "scripts",
    "python3",
    "image-processing",
    "google-api",
    "devops"
]

# Replace all topics
repo.replace_topics(topics)

print(f"Topics updated successfully!")
print(f"Current topics: {repo.get_topics()}")
```

**Pros:**
- Pythonic approach
- Easy to integrate with other Python code
- Good for automation

**Cons:**
- Requires PyGithub installation
- Requires Python environment

### Method 5: GitHub GraphQL API

GitHub's GraphQL API provides another way to manage topics.

#### GraphQL Mutation:

**Note:** GraphQL currently has limitations with topics. The REST API is recommended for topics management.

---

## Quick Reference Commands

### Using GitHub CLI (via API):

```bash
# View current topics
gh api /repos/Baneeishaque/Python-TUI-Scripts/topics

# Set topics
gh api --method PUT /repos/Baneeishaque/Python-TUI-Scripts/topics \
  -f names='["python","python-scripts","automation","cli-tools","utilities","pillow","google-keep","gkeepapi","google-oauth","homebrew","docker","vagrant","azure-pipelines","ci-cd","developer-tools","scripts","python3","image-processing","google-api","devops"]'
```

### Using curl:

```bash
# Set your token
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_token_here"

# Add topics
curl -X PUT \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"names":["python","python-scripts","automation","cli-tools","utilities","pillow","google-keep","gkeepapi","google-oauth","homebrew","docker","vagrant","azure-pipelines","ci-cd","developer-tools","scripts","python3","image-processing","google-api","devops"]}' \
  https://api.github.com/repos/Baneeishaque/Python-TUI-Scripts/topics
```

## Best Practices for GitHub Topics

1. **Limit to 20 topics**: GitHub allows up to 20 topics per repository
2. **Use lowercase**: Topics are case-insensitive but displayed in lowercase
3. **Use hyphens for multi-word topics**: e.g., `python-scripts` not `python_scripts`
4. **Be specific**: Choose topics that accurately describe your project
5. **Include popular topics**: Use well-known topics to improve discoverability
6. **Avoid redundancy**: Don't use synonyms (e.g., both `scripts` and `scripting`)
7. **Update regularly**: Keep topics current as your project evolves
